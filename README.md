<h1>Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet</h1>

<p>This project is a web-based application that visualizes earthquake data using the Leaflet.js library. The data is sourced from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, providing a real-time overview of seismic activity around the globe. The visualization allows users to explore earthquake occurrences, magnitudes, and depths interactively on a map.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Interactive map displaying earthquake locations based on latitude and longitude.</li>
  <li>Markers are styled dynamically:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Size:</strong> Represents the magnitude of the earthquake.</li>
      <li><strong>Color:</strong> Represents the depth of the earthquake. Darker colors indicate greater depth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Popups for each marker provide detailed information, including the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake.</li>
  <li>A <strong>legend</strong> in the bottom-right corner explains the color scheme used for depth visualization.</li>
  <li>Users can switch between two map views:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grayscale:</strong> A simple, high-contrast map view.</li>
      <li><strong>Satellite:</strong> A topographical map view.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overlay options allow users to toggle the visibility of:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tectonic Plates:</strong> Visualizes tectonic plate boundaries on the map.</li>
      <li><strong>Earthquakes:</strong> Toggles the display of earthquake markers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
